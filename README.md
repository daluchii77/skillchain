# Milestone-Based Crowdfunding Smart Contract

A decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Stacks that revolutionizes project funding through milestone-based fund releases and community governance.

## üåü Overview

This smart contract addresses the fundamental trust issues in traditional crowdfunding platforms by implementing a milestone-based fund release system. Instead of releasing all funds upfront, funds are released incrementally as project creators achieve predefined milestones that are verified by the contributor community.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Milestone-Based Fund Release**
- Project creators define 1-10 milestones for their project
- Each milestone specifies a percentage of total funds to be released
- Funds remain locked in the contract until milestones are approved
- Sequential milestone completion ensures project progression

### 2. **Community-Driven Verification**
- Contributors vote on milestone completion
- Configurable approval thresholds (50-100% of contributors)
- Democratic process ensures quality delivery
- One vote per contributor per milestone prevents manipulation

### 3. **Contributor Protection**
- Automatic refunds for cancelled or expired projects
- Partial refunds based on uncompleted milestones
- Transparent fund tracking
- Withdrawal mechanisms for failed projects

### 4. **Platform Sustainability**
- Configurable platform fee (default: 2.5%)
- Fees only collected on successfully released funds
- Admin controls for fee adjustment
- Sustainable revenue model for platform maintenance
